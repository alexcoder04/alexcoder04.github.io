Hello there, I'm presenting my personal website to you.

I finally got around to take a look at Jekyll and publish a simple site on GitHub pages.
I am planning to create an overview of my projects, which I consider worth looking
at and I may write some blog posts about different programming things from time to time.

Stay tuned and subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml).
