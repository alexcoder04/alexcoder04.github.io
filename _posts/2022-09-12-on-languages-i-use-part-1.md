# My first experiences and the Web

I've tried a couple of programming languages already and in this series of
posts, I want to give my opinion on different languages I use now or I tried in
the past in a (more or less) chronological order.

If you are looking for a programming language to learn and want to look around,
you can use this as an overview, but keep in mind, that this is my subjective
opinion.

In this part, we are going to take a look at the first things I got to know and
at the web technologies.

*Part 2 coming soon!*

## Scratch

https://scratch.mit.edu/

Come on, Scratch is not a real programming language. But this is what most kids
start with, and I'm not an exception. In my opinion, Scratch is perfect for
teaching programming concepts to kids by letting them programm fun games. But
after I tried real/text-based programming languages, I could never touch Scratch
again, even despite the very easy and fun way to create nice graphics. The
blocks just don't feel right.

## Python

https://python.org/

Python is the first "real" programming language I tried. Simple syntax, lots of
libraries, tons of tutorials - the reasons why Python is recommended as the
first language are still relevant to me today. I've tried a lot of different
libraries over time (Flask, PyQt, Tensorflow, socket stuff and more) and
gathered a pretty comprehensive Python knowledge. Nowadays, I mainly use Python
for smaller projects, algorithmic tasks and some automatisation scripts - cases
where I don't want to think about syntax, libraries or language features - cases
where I just want to start coding.

Fun fact: I use an interactive Python console as my calculator and line/word
counter.

## HTML and CSS

Well, these are not programming languages. But as Scratch is on this list, I
have talk about these. I don't remember exactly, but it might be possible that
I learned the web technologies even before Python. These are nice things to
know the basics about, if you want to do something related to programming and
computers but I wouldn't be able to teach you about all the CSS tricks. I'm not
really good in creating GUIs and working on these things always takes eternities
for me. Design is not for everyone.

## Javascript

I have a pretty tense relationship with Javascript. Well, I know the basics and
I built a couple of small JS projects, but I never learned to love it. I tried
React 3 times (I guess), but haven't been able to do something meaningful with
it. Javascript and the whole NPM stuff is just a pain in the ?ss to deal with.
The libraries are always huge, comlicated and change with every version.

Javascript has its use cases, of course, but it's way too overused in the modern
tech world. Do you need to load megabytes of JS on every request just to render
a blog or news page with static content? Do you really need to use JS on your
backend while there are lots of faster and easier languages for that? Why are
you building desktop apps with so-called Electron, so that each of them installs
and loads a full copy of Chromium and looks completely different than the rest
of your system?

Javascript was created for building animations and simple functionality as an
addon on top of HTML and CSS. Not the other way around. And definitely not to
replace every single other technology by squeezing it into the browser.

## PHP

https://www.php.net/

Had a look at it, it's fine, it still powers a lot of websites, but it feels to
me that the blue elephant is going to die out in the future, so I don't see the
sense of looking deeper into it.

## SQL

There is not much to say about SQL: very specific use case (databases), very
relevant, not very complex (as long as you are not doing crazy things with it),
so it's worth to learn it if you work with backends and other databases.
