Hello again,

iPadOS 17 is out and it is what defines my new theme.

## Arch Linux GNOME

Still using GNOME with pretty much the same setup; installed some minor extensions
which do not affect the look however.

## Android 13

Still same ROM, still same apps, just new wallpaper and theme...

## iPad (iPadOS 17)

Obviously OS update up to iPadOS 17, use more widgets now and switched to auto light-dark theme
(light from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m., so only for a couple of hours).
