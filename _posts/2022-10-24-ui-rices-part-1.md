In a "UI rices" series of posts, I want to share some
of my thoughts on design - by ricing the appearance of
my own desktop, phone and more.

Currently, I have an Apple-inspired theme on both my desktop
and phone.

## Linux Mint 21 - "Mice"

```text
"mac" + "nice" = "mice"
```

This my Linux Mint Cinnamon desktop - macOS Monterey wallpaper
featuring the default Linux Mint theme with fitting
purple accent color and CPU/RAM/disk monitoring applet
in light colors plus "transparent bar" extension.
Not much more.

## Android 11 - "iOS 16"

My phone running LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11) offers some
customization options, though much more limited as a Linux desktop.

I use the iOS 16 wallpaper with a blue accent color and "squircle"
icons - and of course a dark theme ;)
I love a clean home screen, so only a search bar and a couple of most
used apps are present there.
