Hey,

a lot has happened since my last UI rices post. I've switches OS on my desktop
and phone and there is a lot of new stuff to see.

And - my new theme is called Kobold.

## Arch Linux GNOME

I've switched from Artix to plain Arch due to usability and simplicity reasons.
I don't hate systemd, so I hadn't much a reason to stay on Artix. And change is
always nice!

I used the switch to also try out a new desktop environment. I used GNOME 3 for
a short time on Ubuntu and I hated it. However, I'm really interesed in the DE
since the 40 version as they are doing stuff that is very innovative.

A couple of things were a kind of hassle to set up and some very random bugs
were here and there which turned out to be just misconfiguration. However, now
I genuinely LOVE GNOME on a laptop. The touchpad gestures are very smooth and
play well together with the well-thought virtual desktop implementation. And
the super key with the global search is just phenomenal. I already always
launched programs by hitting the super key and searching in KDE, so the GNOME
version matches my workflow exactly.

It is also worth mentioning that I have some extensions enabled, most notably
"Blur my Shell", "Caffeine" and "Date Menu Formatter".

## Android 13

For some time, I used the LeafOS ROM, which is also maintained my [SamarV-121](https://samarv121.dev/).

However, something went a little wrong during an update. so I switched back to (unofficial) LineageOS.

My home screen is still pretty clean, however I added a clock this time.

## iPad (iOS 16)

There is actually a rather big update on the iPad side this time. The wallpaper
is of course the same one, from the GNOME wallpaper pack, however, I sorted all
my apps into categories to keep everything tidy.
