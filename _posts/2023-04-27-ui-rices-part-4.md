Hello everyone,

the winter is over, so it is time to switch to a new, more warm theme.

This time, I decided to use a picture of the North Sea as the background and
add the beautiful Gruvbox colorscheme to it; so this new theme receives the name
"North Sea".

Enjoy!

## Artix Linux KDE

Still on Artix, still on KDE, still very happy with it!

However, I made my desktop somewhat more minimal by removing the bottom panel.
This has two main reasons: firstly, I ended up never using the app icons to
switch between apps, as I open everything on different workspaces anyway and use
the touchpad gestures to navigate between them. Secondly, as I already had a top
panel with some tray icons in it, the only logical step was to move the rest of
them in the same place, too. So, only the main menu, which I only access via the
super key anyway, and the workspace indicator were left, and it was not a major
deal to move them into the top panel as well.

By implementing these changes, I managed to save some screen space without
losing any comfort.

The Plasma and Qt theme is warm Gruvbox, which I already used on tiling window
managers before and like quite a lot. And btw, Firefox is configured using
Gruvbox as well!

## Android 13

Nothing really changed here, still on the same ROM by [SamarV-121](https://samarv121.wtf/),
still not using the phone very often.

Btw, the warm accent color Android suggested me for that wallpaper actually
made me use Gruvbox on the PC.

P. S.: I am [looking for a new phone](https://alexcoder04.github.io/2023/04/27/new-phone.html),
maybe you have some recommendations?

## iPad (iOS 16)

Well, as you know, I'm not a huge fan of Apple products and I don't have very
much customization options there.

Nevertheless, I cleaned up my home screen layout to be more simple and less
destructive.
