In this post, I want to capture, what I think the tech scene will look like
in 5 years.

### 1. ARM processors

ARM is already a very wide used architecture. It is used in nearly all smartphones,
IoT devices and even calculators. With Apple switching their Macs to a custom
built ARM chip, they are setting a trend for the last space x86 is still dominant.
In my opinion, ARM chips will take over the desktop and laptops. Maybe we will
see a rise of new producer companies, maybe Intel and AMD will switch their products,
but I'm pretty sure that ARM will take over.

### 2. Elon Musk

Elon Musk owns major companies in the automobile and space industry. This year,
he wanted to buy Twitter for some time but changed his mind. I think, he is not
going to give up and will have bought or founded a major company in the IT
space by 2027.

### 3. Laptops

We can already see the trend today: tablets and flexible notebooks with a touch
screen are becoming more and more popular. I am sure that this will go on and
almost all laptops will be replaced by tablets or similar devices in the next
5 years.

### 4. Fuchsia OS

Google has been working on an own operating system for a while already. It will
be called Fuchsia and should run on all kinds of devices, from IoT to servers.
We will see first devices with Fuchsia entering the market and Google publicly
presenting their OS in the next 5 years.

### 5. Even more "Smart" and "Cloud"

The smart things era started already: IoT devices, like smart watches, smart lamps,
smart refrigerators became mainstream in the last couple of years. Although I
personally don't like this developments (maybe I'll write a more elaborated post
on this in the future), I assume, that nearly everything will be hooked up to
the internet in five years: from big household appliances like washing machines
to smallest items like clothes.
