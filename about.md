## Me

Hello, I'm alexcoder04, a hobbyist open-source developer.

My favourite programming languages are Golang, Python and POSIX Shell.

I am a Linux-only user and fan for already two years, currently on dual-boot
with Linux Mint and Artix Linux.

## Experiences and skills

*In progress*

## This site

This is my personal website, where you can find my best projects and some
thoughts on different topics.

This website has **no** commercial background. No ads, no product placements etc.
Just some info about me.
